# General Overview

The different APIs accessible by this gem are:

- [Products](products_api.md)
- [Stores](stores_api.md)
- [Categories](categories_api.md)

In spite of having each their own specification, they all share some basics listed here.

## Common interface

This method can be used with any of the APIs:

#### `get_all(search_query:, pagination:)`
_alias: `index`_

Retrieves a collection of items (these depend on the API). These items will be filtered by `search_query` and limited by `pagination`.

Params:

- `search_query`: A string representing the query added to the URL to filter the items (See [Search Techniques](https://bestbuyapis.github.io/api-documentation/#search-techniques) in the Best Buy API reference). Optional.
- `pagination`: See [Pagination](general_overview.md#pagination). Optional.

Returns: a [`CollectionsResponse`](general_overview.md#collections-response) object

```ruby
search_query = '(active=true)'
pagination_params = { page: 2, page_size: 20 }

BestBuy::Categories.new(your_api_key).get_all(search_query: search_query, pagination: pagination_params)
```

## Collections response

Every request made that returns a collection of items (no matter what *kind* of item) will return an object called `CollectionsResponse`. This object contains two attributes:

- `header`
- `collection`

The `collection` will contain a list of objects of the requested collection (`Product`, `Store`, etc).

The `header` will be a `CollectionHeader` object which will contain some metadata of the request itself. Its attributes include:

- `canonical_url`: the non-server part of the query
- `current_page`: the page being returned
- `partial`: flag indicating whether or not the query returned only partial results (in the event of a timeout)
- `from`: the index of the first item returned on the current page
- `to`: the index of the last item returned on the current page
- `total`: the total number of items returned by the query
- `total_pages`: the number of pages required to list all items
- `query_time`: the time required to search the database
- `total_time`: the time required to parse, search, format and return results

## Pagination

Best Buy APIs accept pagination parameters to control the amount of results returned. That's why for the `get_all` method, for example, there's an optional `pagination` parameter, which consists of a hash with two also optional keys:

- `:page`: number of the page of results youâ€™d like returned
- `:page_size`: amount of results per page (default: 10, max: 100)

Example:
```ruby
pagination_params = { page: 3, page_size: 50 }

BestBuy::Stores.new(your_api_key).get_all(pagination: pagination_params)
```
